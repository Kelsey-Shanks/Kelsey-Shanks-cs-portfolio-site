                            This is my Web Development course portfolio project at Oregon State University.
                            Due to my university's policies, I cannot share this work in a public manner, but I am
                            allowed to share it privately to prospective employers. This project is a React.js frontend
                            with a REST API backend interfacing with a MongoDB database. It tracks inputted excercises 
                            and allows the user to edit existing exercises and add new ones.

                        <p>
                            This is my Data Structures course portfolio project at Oregon State University.
                            Due to my university's policies, I cannot share this work in a public manner, but I am
                            allowed to share it privately to prospective employers. This project is a collection of
                            two program implementations--one is a hash map with open addressing for collision resolution
                            and the other is a singly linked list using chaining for collision resolution.

                        <p>
                            This is a Python project from my Intro to Programming II course at Oregon State University.
                            Due to my university's policies, I cannot share this work in a public manner, but I am
                            allowed to share it privately to prospective employers. This project is essentially a 
                            game of chess, but with altered rules and the pieces are characters. My original program
                            was just the functioning code for the game, but after the conclusion of the course, I 
                            started designing a user interface with tkinter to visualize the game being played. Due 
                            to limited time between the Spring and Summer quarters, I did not complete the UI, but 
                            the program itself is functional.
                        </p>

                <p>
                    If you would like to see more details regarding my coursework, I can send those privately to a 
                    prospective employer, so please reach out if you'd like to see those projects.
