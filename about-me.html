                            <li>
                                <h4>Music</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Due to the nature of Kelsey's previous education, she is particularly interested in 
                                    developing software that is connected to music education, music entertainment, or music technology. 
                                    However, she has a growing interest in cybersecurity and user interface design due to her 
                                    coursework at Oregon State University and has taken courses to learn more about those facets 
                                    of computer science.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    In addition to music, Kelsey is also interested in careers in cybersecurity. She is set to take 
                                    Intro to Computer Networks and Intro to Security as electives to delve deeper into the subject 
                                    as well as take the Security+ certification exam in the next few months.

                                <p>
                                    Her interest also extends to user interface design after taking Web Development and Intro to 
                                    Usability Engineering. From those courses, she's worked with React.js, REST API, Node.js, Figma, 
                                    HTML, and UX research to design a product.

                                <p>
                                    From her time in high school attending Francis Tuttle Bioscience and Medicine Academy to now, 
                                    Kelsey has always had a keen interest in medicine and healthcare. Due to this, she conducted 
                                    her usability project on making a personal health portal that interfaced with wearable biometric
                                    devices (e.g. Garmin watches).
